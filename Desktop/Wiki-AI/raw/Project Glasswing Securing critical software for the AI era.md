## Introduction

#### Today we’re announcing Project Glasswing1, a new initiative that brings together Amazon Web Services, Anthropic, Apple, Broadcom, Cisco, CrowdStrike, Google, JPMorganChase, the Linux Foundation, Microsoft, NVIDIA, and Palo Alto Networks in an effort to secure the world’s most critical software.

We formed Project Glasswing because of capabilities we’ve observed in a new frontier model trained by Anthropic that we believe could reshape cybersecurity. Claude Mythos <sup>2</sup> Preview is a general-purpose, unreleased frontier model that reveals a stark fact: AI models have reached a level of coding capability where they can surpass all but the most skilled humans at finding and exploiting software vulnerabilities.

Mythos Preview has already found thousands of high-severity vulnerabilities, including some in *every major operating system and web browser*. Given the rate of AI progress, it will not be long before such capabilities proliferate, potentially beyond actors who are committed to deploying them safely. The fallout—for economies, public safety, and national security—could be severe. Project Glasswing is an urgent attempt to put these capabilities to work for defensive purposes.

As part of Project Glasswing, the launch partners listed above will use Mythos Preview as part of their defensive security work; Anthropic will share what we learn so the whole industry can benefit. We have also extended access to a group of over 40 additional organizations that build or maintain critical software infrastructure so they can use the model to scan and secure both first-party and open-source systems. Anthropic is committing up to $100M in usage credits for Mythos Preview across these efforts, as well as $4M in direct donations to open-source security organizations.

Project Glasswing is a starting point. No one organization can solve these cybersecurity problems alone: frontier AI developers, other software companies, security researchers, open-source maintainers, and governments across the world all have essential roles to play. The work of defending the world’s cyber infrastructure might take years; frontier AI capabilities are likely to advance substantially over just the next few months. For cyber defenders to come out ahead, we need to act now.

## Cybersecurity in the age of AI

The software that all of us rely on every day—responsible for running banking systems, storing medical records, linking up logistics networks, keeping power grids functioning, and much more—has always contained bugs. Many are minor, but some are serious security flaws that, if discovered, could allow cyberattackers to hijack systems, disrupt operations, or steal data.

We have already seen the serious consequences of cyberattacks for important [corporate networks](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/oracle-ebusiness-suite-zero-day-exploitation), [healthcare systems](https://www.nao.org.uk/reports/investigation-wannacry-cyber-attack-and-the-nhs/), [energy infrastructure](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/news/attack-colonial-pipeline-what-weve-learned-what-weve-done-over-past-two-years), [transport hubs](https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/lessons-from-the-european-airports-ransomware-attack), and the information security of [government](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/hackers-solarwinds-breach-stole-data-us-sanctions-policy-intelligence-probes-2021-10-07/) [agencies](https://www.reuters.com/technology/cybersecurity/us-treasurys-workstations-hacked-cyberattack-by-china-afp-reports-2024-12-30/) [across](https://lordslibrary.parliament.uk/cyber-security-and-the-uk-government/) the world. On the global stage, state-sponsored attacks from actors like China, Iran, North Korea, and Russia have threatened to compromise the infrastructure that underpins both civilian life and military readiness. Even smaller-scale attacks, such as those where individual [hospitals](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2950386825000103) or [schools](https://www.vic.gov.au/cyber-incident-impacting-victorian-government-schools) are targeted, can still inflict substantial economic damage, expose sensitive data, and even put lives at risk. The current global financial costs of cybercrime are challenging to estimate, but might be [around $500B](https://www.governance.ai/research-paper/estimating-global-yearly-cybercrime-damage-costs) every year.

Many flaws in software go unnoticed for years because finding and exploiting them has required expertise held by only a few skilled security experts. With the latest frontier AI models, the cost, effort, and level of expertise required to find and exploit software vulnerabilities have all dropped dramatically. [Over the past year](https://www.anthropic.com/research/building-ai-cyber-defenders), AI models have become increasingly effective at reading and reasoning about code—in particular, they show a striking ability to spot [vulnerabilities](https://red.anthropic.com/2026/firefox/) and work out ways to [exploit](https://red.anthropic.com/2026/exploit/) them. Claude Mythos Preview demonstrates a leap in these cyber skills—the vulnerabilities it has spotted have in some cases survived decades of human review and millions of automated security tests, and the exploits it develops are increasingly sophisticated.

Ten years after the first [DARPA Cyber Grand Challenge](https://www.darpa.mil/research/programs/cyber-grand-challenge), frontier AI models are now becoming competitive with the best humans at finding and exploiting vulnerabilities. Without the [necessary safeguards](https://openai.com/index/strengthening-cyber-resilience/), these powerful cyber capabilities could be used to exploit the many existing flaws in the world’s most important software. This could make cyberattacks of all kinds much more frequent and destructive, and empower adversaries of the United States and its allies. Addressing these issues is therefore an important security priority for democratic states.

Although the risks from AI-augmented cyberattacks are serious, there is reason for optimism: the same capabilities that make AI models dangerous in the wrong hands make them invaluable for finding and fixing flaws in important software—and for producing new software with far fewer security bugs. Project Glasswing is an important step toward giving defenders a durable advantage in the coming AI-driven era of cybersecurity.

## Identifying vulnerabilities and exploits with Claude Mythos Preview

Over the past few weeks, we have used Claude Mythos Preview to identify thousands of zero-day vulnerabilities (that is, flaws that were previously unknown to the software’s developers), many of them critical, in every major operating system and every major web browser, along with a range of other important pieces of software.

In a post on our [Frontier Red Team blog](https://red.anthropic.com/2026/mythos-preview), we provide technical details for a subset of these vulnerabilities that have already been patched and, in some cases, the ways that Mythos Preview found to exploit them. It was able to identify nearly all of these vulnerabilities—and develop many related exploits—entirely autonomously, without any human steering. The following are three examples:

- Mythos Preview found a 27-year-old vulnerability in OpenBSD—which has a reputation as one of the most security-hardened operating systems in the world and is used to run firewalls and other critical infrastructure. The vulnerability allowed an attacker to remotely crash any machine running the operating system just by connecting to it;
- It also discovered a 16-year-old vulnerability in FFmpeg—which is used by innumerable pieces of software to encode and decode video—in a line of code that automated testing tools had hit five million times without ever catching the problem;
- The model autonomously found and chained together several vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel—the software that runs most of the world’s servers—to allow an attacker to escalate from ordinary user access to complete control of the machine.

We have reported the above vulnerabilities to the maintainers of the relevant software, and they have all now been patched. For many other vulnerabilities, we are providing a cryptographic hash of the details today (see the Red Team blog), and we will reveal the specifics after a fix is in place.

Evaluation benchmarks such as CyberGym reinforce the substantial difference between Mythos Preview and our next-best model, Claude Opus 4.6:

In addition to our own work, many of our partners have already been using Claude Mythos Preview for several weeks. This is what they’ve found:

“AI capabilities have crossed a threshold that fundamentally changes the urgency required to protect critical infrastructure from cyber threats, and there is no going back. Our foundational work with these models has shown we can identify and fix security vulnerabilities across hardware and software at a pace and scale previously impossible. That is a profound shift, and a clear signal that the old ways of hardening systems are no longer sufficient. Providers of technology must aggressively adopt new approaches now, and customers need to be ready to deploy. That is why Cisco joined Project Glasswing—this work is too important and too urgent to do alone.”

Anthony Grieco

SVP & Chief Security & Trust Officer, Cisco

“At AWS, we build defenses before threats emerge, from our custom silicon up through the technology stack. Security isn't a phase for us; it's continuous and embedded in everything we do. Our teams analyze over 400 trillion network flows every day for threats, and AI is central to our ability to defend at scale. We've been testing Claude Mythos Preview in our own security operations, applying it to critical codebases, where it's already helping us strengthen our code. We're bringing deep security expertise to our partnership with Anthropic and are helping to harden Claude Mythos Preview so even more organizations can advance their most ambitious work with security that sets the standard.”

Amy Herzog

Vice President and CISO, Amazon Web Services

“As we enter a phase where cybersecurity is no longer bound by purely human capacity, the opportunity to use AI responsibly to improve security and reduce risk at scale is unprecedented. Joining Project Glasswing, with access to Claude Mythos Preview, allows us to identify and mitigate risk early and augment our security and development solutions so we can better protect customers and Microsoft. When tested against CTI-REALM, our open-source security benchmark, Claude Mythos Preview showed substantial improvements compared to previous models. We look forward to partnering with Anthropic and the broader industry to improve security outcomes for all.”

Igor Tsyganskiy

EVP of Cybersecurity and Microsoft Research, Microsoft

“The window between a vulnerability being discovered and being exploited by an adversary has collapsed—what once took months now happens in minutes with AI. Claude Mythos Preview demonstrates what is now possible for defenders at scale, and adversaries will inevitably look to exploit the same capabilities. That is not a reason to slow down; it’s a reason to move together, faster. If you want to deploy AI, you need security. That is why CrowdStrike is part of this effort from day one.”

Elia Zaitsev

Chief Technology Officer, CrowdStrike

“In the past, security expertise has been a luxury reserved for organizations with large security teams. Open source maintainers—whose software underpins much of the world’s critical infrastructure—have historically been left to figure out security on their own. Open source software constitutes the vast majority of code in modern systems, including the very systems AI agents use to write new software. By giving the maintainers of these critical open source codebases access to a new generation of AI models that can proactively identify and fix vulnerabilities at scale, Project Glasswing offers a credible path to changing that equation. This is how AI-augmented security can become a trusted sidekick for every maintainer, not just those who can afford expensive security teams.”

Jim Zemlin

CEO, The Linux Foundation

“Promoting the cybersecurity and resiliency of the financial system is central to JPMorganChase's mission, and we believe the industry is strongest when leading institutions work together on shared challenges. Project Glasswing provides a unique, early stage opportunity to evaluate next-generation AI tools for defensive cybersecurity across critical infrastructure both on our own terms and alongside respected technology leaders. We will take a rigorous, independent approach to determining how to proceed and where we can help. Anthropic's initiative reflects the kind of forward-looking, collaborative approach that this moment demands.”

Pat Opet

Chief Information Security Officer, JPMorganChase

“Google is pleased to see this cross-industry cybersecurity initiative coming together and to make Mythos Preview available to participants via Vertex AI. It's always been critical that the industry work together on emerging security issues, whether it's post-quantum cryptography, responsible zero-day disclosure, secure open source software, or defense against AI-based attacks. We have long believed that AI poses new challenges and opens new opportunities in cyber defense, which is why we've built AI-powered tools—such as Big Sleep and CodeMender—to find and fix critical software flaws. We will continue investing in our leading cybersecurity platform and a culture focused on protecting users, customers, the ecosystem, and national security.”

Heather Adkins

VP of Security Engineering, Google

“Over the past few weeks, we’ve had access to the Claude Mythos Preview model, using it to identify complex vulnerabilities that prior-generation models missed entirely. This is not only a game changer for finding previously hidden vulnerabilities, but it also signals a dangerous shift where attackers can soon find even more zero-day vulnerabilities and develop exploits faster than ever before. It’s clear that these models need to be in the hands of open source owners and defenders everywhere to find and fix these vulnerabilities before attackers get access. Perhaps even more important: everyone needs to prepare for AI-assisted attackers. There will be more attacks, faster attacks, and more sophisticated attacks. Now is the time to modernize cybersecurity stacks everywhere. We commend Anthropic for partnering with the industry to ensure these powerful capabilities prioritize defense first.”

Lee Klarich

Chief Product & Technology Officer, Palo Alto Networks

The powerful cyber capabilities of Claude Mythos Preview are a result of its strong agentic coding and reasoning skills. For example, as shown in the evaluation results below, the model has the highest scores of any model yet developed on a variety of software coding tasks.

More information on the model’s capabilities, its safety properties, and its general characteristics can be found in the [Claude Mythos Preview system card](https://anthropic.com/claude-mythos-preview-system-card).

We do not plan to make Claude Mythos Preview generally available, but our eventual goal is to enable our users to safely deploy Mythos-class models at scale—for cybersecurity purposes, but also for the myriad other benefits that such highly capable models will bring. To do so, we need to make progress in developing cybersecurity (and other) safeguards that detect and block the model’s most dangerous outputs. We plan to launch new safeguards with an upcoming Claude Opus model, allowing us to improve and refine them with a model that does not pose the same level of risk as Mythos Preview <sup>3</sup>.

## Plans for Project Glasswing

Today’s announcement is the beginning of a longer-term effort. To be successful, it will require broad involvement from across the technology industry and beyond.

Project Glasswing partners will receive access to Claude Mythos Preview to find and fix vulnerabilities or weaknesses in their foundational systems—systems that represent a very large portion of the world’s shared cyberattack surface. We anticipate this work will focus on tasks like local vulnerability detection, black box testing of binaries, securing endpoints, and penetration testing of systems.

Anthropic’s commitment of $100M in model usage credits to Project Glasswing and additional participants will cover substantial usage throughout this research preview. Afterward, Claude Mythos Preview will be available to participants at $25/$125 per million input/output tokens (participants can access the model on the Claude API, Amazon Bedrock, Google Cloud’s Vertex AI, and Microsoft Foundry).

In addition to our commitment of model usage credits, we’ve donated $2.5M to Alpha-Omega and OpenSSF through the Linux Foundation, and $1.5M to the Apache Software Foundation to enable the maintainers of open-source software to respond to this changing landscape (maintainers interested in access can apply through the [Claude for Open Source](https://claude.com/contact-sales/claude-for-oss) program).

We intend for this work to grow in scope and continue for many months, and we’ll share as much as we can so that other organizations can apply the lessons to their own security. Partners will, to the extent they’re able, share information and best practices with each other; within 90 days, Anthropic will report publicly on what we’ve learned, as well as the vulnerabilities fixed and improvements made that can be disclosed. We will also collaborate with leading security organizations to produce a set of practical recommendations for how security practices should evolve in the AI era. This will potentially include:

- Vulnerability disclosure processes;
- Software update processes;
- Open-source and supply-chain security;
- Software development lifecycle and secure-by-design practices;
- Standards for regulated industries;
- Triage scaling and automation; and
- Patching automation.

Anthropic has also been in ongoing discussions with US government officials about Claude Mythos Preview and its offensive and defensive cyber capabilities. As we noted above, securing critical infrastructure is a top national security priority for democratic countries—the emergence of these cyber capabilities is another reason why the US and its allies must maintain a decisive lead in AI technology. Governments have an essential role to play in helping maintain that lead, and in both assessing and mitigating the national security risks associated with AI models. We are ready to work with local, state, and federal representatives to assist in these tasks.

We are hopeful that Project Glasswing can seed a larger effort across industry and the public sector, with all parties helping to address the biggest questions around the impact of powerful models on security. We invite other AI industry members to join us in helping to set the standards for the industry. In the medium term, an independent, third-party body—one that can bring together private- and public-sector organizations—might be the ideal home for continued work on these large-scale cybersecurity projects.

## APPENDIX

1. The project is named for the glasswing butterfly, [*Greta oto*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greta_oto). The metaphor can be applied in two ways: the butterfly’s transparent wings let it hide in plain sight, much like the vulnerabilities discussed in this post; they also allow it to evade harm—like the transparency we’re advocating for in our approach.
2. From the Ancient Greek for “utterance” or “narrative”: the system of stories through which civilizations made sense of the world.
3. Security professionals whose legitimate work is affected by these safeguards will be able to apply to an upcoming Cyber Verification Program.

## 프로젝트 글라스윙

AI 시대를 위한 핵심 소프트웨어 보안

## 소개

오늘 우리는 프로젝트 글라스윙을 발표합니다. Amazon Web Services, Anthropic, Apple, Broadcom, Cisco, CrowdStrike, Google, JPMorganChase, Linux Foundation, Microsoft, NVIDIA, Palo Alto Networks가 함께하는 새로운 이니셔티브로 세계에서 가장 중요한 소프트웨어를 보안하기 위한 노력입니다.

우리는 사이버보안을 재편할 수 있다고 믿는 Anthropic이 훈련한 새로운 프론티어 모델에서 관찰한 역량 때문에 프로젝트 글라스윙을 결성했습니다. Claude Mythos Preview는 명백한 사실을 드러내는 미출시 범용 프론티어 모델입니다: AI 모델이 소프트웨어 취약점 발견 및 악용에서 가장 숙련된 인간을 제외한 모든 인간을 능가할 수 있는 코딩 역량 수준에 도달했습니다.

Mythos Preview는 이미 *모든 주요 운영 체제 및 웹 브라우저*를 포함하여 수천 개의 고심각도 취약점을 발견했습니다. AI 진보 속도를 감안하면, 이러한 역량이 안전하게 배포하는 데 전념하는 행위자를 넘어서 확산되기 전까지 오래 걸리지 않을 것입니다. 경제, 공중 안전, 국가 안보에 대한 파급 효과는 심각할 수 있습니다. 프로젝트 글라스윙은 이러한 역량을 방어 목적으로 활용하려는 긴급한 시도입니다.

프로젝트 글라스윙의 일환으로, 위에 나열된 출범 파트너들은 방어적 보안 작업의 일부로 Mythos Preview를 사용할 것입니다; Anthropic은 전체 업계가 혜택을 받을 수 있도록 우리가 배운 것을 공유할 것입니다. 우리는 또한 핵심 소프트웨어 인프라를 구축하거나 유지하는 40개 이상의 추가 조직에 접근권을 확장하여 그들이 모델을 사용해 1차 및 오픈소스 시스템 모두를 스캔하고 보안할 수 있도록 했습니다. Anthropic은 이러한 노력에 걸쳐 Mythos Preview 사용 크레딧으로 최대 $1억을 약정하고, 오픈소스 보안 조직에 $400만의 직접 기부도 약정합니다.

프로젝트 글라스윙은 출발점입니다. 어떤 단일 조직도 이러한 사이버보안 문제를 혼자 해결할 수 없습니다: 프론티어 AI 개발자, 다른 소프트웨어 회사, 보안 연구원, 오픈소스 유지 관리자, 그리고 전 세계 정부 모두가 필수적인 역할을 해야 합니다.

## AI 시대의 사이버보안

우리 모두가 매일 의존하는 소프트웨어 — 은행 시스템 운영, 의료 기록 저장, 물류 네트워크 연결, 전력망 유지 등 — 는 항상 버그를 포함해 왔습니다. 많은 것들이 사소하지만, 일부는 심각한 보안 결함으로, 발견될 경우 사이버 공격자들이 시스템을 탈취하고, 운영을 방해하거나, 데이터를 훔칠 수 있게 합니다.

소프트웨어의 결함을 찾고 악용하는 데는 소수의 숙련된 보안 전문가만이 보유한 전문성이 필요했기 때문에 많은 결함이 수년간 발견되지 않았습니다. 최신 프론티어 AI 모델로 소프트웨어 취약점 발견 및 악용에 필요한 비용, 노력, 전문 지식 수준이 모두 크게 낮아졌습니다.

## Claude Mythos Preview로 취약점 및 악용 방법 식별

지난 몇 주 동안, 우리는 Claude Mythos Preview를 사용하여 모든 주요 운영 체제와 모든 주요 웹 브라우저를 포함한 다양한 중요 소프트웨어에서 수천 개의 제로데이 취약점 (즉, 소프트웨어 개발자에게 이전에 알려지지 않은 결함)을 식별했습니다. 많은 것들이 중요합니다.

세 가지 예:

- Mythos Preview는 OpenBSD에서 27년 된 취약점을 발견했습니다 — 세계에서 가장 보안이 강화된 운영 체제 중 하나라는 명성을 갖고 있으며 방화벽 및 기타 핵심 인프라를 실행하는 데 사용됩니다. 취약점은 공격자가 연결만으로 운영 체제를 실행하는 모든 머신을 원격으로 충돌시킬 수 있게 했습니다;
- 또한 FFmpeg에서 16년 된 취약점을 발견했습니다 — 무수히 많은 소프트웨어가 비디오 인코딩 및 디코딩에 사용하며 — 자동 테스팅 도구가 500만 번 실행한 코드 라인에서 문제를 발견하지 못했습니다;
- 모델이 Linux 커널에서 여러 취약점을 자율적으로 찾아 연결하여 공격자가 일반 사용자 접근에서 머신의 완전한 제어로 에스컬레이션할 수 있게 했습니다.

## 프로젝트 글라스윙 계획

오늘의 발표는 더 장기적인 노력의 시작입니다. 성공하려면 기술 업계 전반과 그 이상에서 광범위한 참여가 필요합니다.

프로젝트 글라스윙 파트너들은 세계의 공유 사이버 공격 표면의 매우 큰 부분을 차지하는 시스템인 기반 시스템의 취약점이나 약점을 찾고 수정하기 위해 Claude Mythos Preview에 대한 접근권을 받을 것입니다.

1. 프로젝트 이름은 유리날개 나비 (*Greta oto*)에서 따왔습니다. 비유는 두 가지 방식으로 적용됩니다: 나비의 투명한 날개가 평범한 광경에 숨게 해줍니다, 이 글에서 논의되는 취약점처럼; 또한 피해를 회피할 수 있게 합니다 — 우리가 우리의 접근 방식에서 옹호하는 투명성처럼.
2. 고대 그리스어로 "발화" 또는 "이야기": 문명이 세상을 이해하는 데 사용하는 이야기 시스템.
3. 합법적인 작업이 이러한 안전장치에 영향을 받는 보안 전문가는 다가오는 사이버 검증 프로그램을 통해 신청할 수 있습니다.
